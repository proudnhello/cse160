      For the awesomeness criteria, I did a number of things. 
      First, I added a color picker for the user to select new colors, instead of just the RGB sliders that were required.
      This should make it easier for the user to select a color they want, instead of having to fiddle with the sliders. 
      That being said, the sliders are still functional, and the color that will be used will be the one that was last changed.
      I also added an alpha channel, so that users would be able to user transparent paint. 
      This works with both the sliders and the color picker, where the alpha on the slider will be applied to whichever color is currently in use.
      Finally, I added the option to undo and redo brush strokes. 
      Instead of storing individual shapes in the shapes array, I now save all the shapes created by a single brush stroke in an array, which is then added to shapes.
      When undo is selected, the last brush stroke is removed from shapes, and added to the redo array, and visa versa for redo. 
      This makes painting much easier, as the user can now undo and redo brush strokes, instead of having to clear the entire canvas.
